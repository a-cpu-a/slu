Fn Expression {
    
    Creates a global function object, that can be used inside impls / traits.

    If there is no self arg, it doesnt use Self and there is a block, then it is equivalent to writing the function in non-expression form somewhere else, and using it by name in the expression.
    For example:
    ```slu
    const x = fn(){}
    ```
    Can be converted to:
    ```slu
    fn _syn_1(){}

    const x = _syn_1
    ```
