Erase Trait {

	Illegal to implement manually.
	
	Marks a type as having a empty drop function or one that can always be ignored (and should be ignored when possible).
	Its purpose is to skip calling drop when possible.
}
Drop Trait {
	method .drop(in = *mut T)
	if T is Erase, then Drop is auto implemented. (auto impl is a empty fn)
	otherwise, is auto implemented by dropping all members.
}
