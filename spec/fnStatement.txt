Fn Statement {
	
	Creates a new global or local function with a name 'Name', that cant be modified.
	
	
	If the "struct" tag is added, then this function returns a nominal/strong type, and it must always return a type or a error.
	
	
	Param types, and return type are assigned automatically, if missing.
	
	Params are immutable / constant by default.
	
	Partially equivalent to "local function x() end", except, it can be exported.
	
	Implementation {
		In lua, this can be a local function, or a global function, could also be a table with a special metatable.
		The function might be frozen at runtime (metatable, or internal stuff)
		If something somehow modifies the function variable, the changes might be ignored.
