	--TODO: do we even need restrictions?
	-- the only loss would be '5 or 7 or 11' type of stuff, unless you type it out using a 'if'
	
	Lets you match on a expressions result.
	
	The return type is assigned automatically, if missing.
	
	First matching pattern will be used. (top to bottom)
	The order inside the patterns is undefined.
	
	Match statements must always handle all inputs.
	If some inputs wouldnt match, then a soft-error occurs, and a " else => panic!(); " is inserted.
	It is an soft-error to have multiple cases that are identical, without any if checks.
	
	"extraFieldSignifier" is required, when a field / array element is ignored, or when matching on dynamicaly-sized arrays.
	
	Implementation {
		May be a jump table, if else chain, etc.
