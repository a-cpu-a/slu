Errors {
	
	The type specifier `~` is used to create a `Result` type.
	Those types are the only ones allowed for the `?` unary operator.
	When returning errors by value, it is a variant containing the Error, and the Value.
	When returning errors by exception, it is optimized into just the Value (or nothing at all).
	
	`Result` types also have some utility functions {
		get(self, p=impl Panic) ->Value 					--Panics, if it is a error, otherwise returns the value.
		getOr(self, default=Value) ->Value					--Returns value, or the default value
		wrapError(self, op=ErrWrapFunc(E,Err)) ->Value~E	--Changes the error, (only if it is an error)
	}
	
	Postfix `?` unary operator passes the error upwards, this means the function must return a `Result` type or a try block must handle it.
	When using `?` at const time without anything to pass it to, the error is passed to the compiler, otherwise the value is returned.
	If an error is silently ignored, a soft-error is logged at compile-time, and the operator is inserted.
	Using the `?` operator on types that arent specified with `~`, is a soft-error. (operator is ignored)
	
	To explicitly ignore a error use drop.
	(drop myErroringFunc();)
	
	The throw statement is used to return a error.
	
	--TODO: choose a way for devs to configure between "stack unwinding" and "return value"
	-- AND make the differences clear.
	-- Option: allow specifying the chance of error (1% -> stack unwind, 10% -> return value)
	-- Option: allow specifying the code-size preferance (smaller -> stack unwind (only in big projects), bigger -> return value)
	-- Option: ignore the fact devs are wrongly biased on this issue, and add some keywords. (errval | unwind)
	Try expressions allow you to handle errors from a function call.
	Any unmatched errors are automatically propagated outside, letting you use a "?" operator again.
	
	Try expressions are a wrapper for using match twice.
	Once to unwrap into value & error, returning instantly unless it is an error.
	Second to figure out what kind of error it is, and then handle it.
	
	First matching pattern will be used. (top to bottom)
	The order inside the patterns is undefined.
	
	Unmatched errors are passed down as if they werent ever caught, and are added to the return type, if it isnt already specified,
	this means that you have to use the `?` operator, or catch it elsewhere.

	fn myErrFunc() -> u8~Err {
		-- ...
		throw Err::Oom{};-- Error!
		-- ...
	}
	
	try{}catch{}

	let u8 passTheError = myErrFunc()?;				-- Get the value or propagate the error
	let u8 panicOnError = myErrFunc().get();		-- Get the value or panic
	let u8 neverError = myErrFunc().getOr(100);	-- Get the value or return ...
	
	let u8 differentError = myErrFunc()
		.wrapError(|e| "Oh no: "++e); -- Changes the error type, and prefixes the error message.
	
	let u8 qq = myErrFunc() try {
	
		-- The return type of the try is optional. 
		-- -> u8~(some variant), the ~ and the stuff after it, would be needed since we arent matching every error.
		
		Err::Pmsg x => panic!("Error " ++ x.1);-- Pmsg is a tuple, we are indexing into the first element
		
		Err::Oom => panic!("Out of memory!");
		Err::Msg{v} => do {
			print(v);
			
			return 0;
		}
		
		-- If this is was added, "?" suffix wouldnt be needed, cuz Err::Unknown would be caught.
		--_ => panic!("Unknown error"); 
		
	}?;-- Try is suffixed with a ?, since "Err::Unknown" isnt handled.
	```
	
	Implementation {
		
		Errors can be handled via exceptions (stack unwinding) or returned as values.
		
		The compiler can choose which will be faster in some cases.
		A compiler flag to choose the default should exist, and most of the time it should default to "unwind"
		
		Return by value could be implemented using a register flag.
		
		error types will either be turned into some tuple, just the value, or Unit.
		Functions returning errors could be compiled twice, to allow users to use both exceptions and error values.
		It is recommended for compilers to defer the duplication to as late as possible.
		(Static linking -> no split)
		(Dynamic linking -> no choice but to split)
