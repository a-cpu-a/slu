Naming Conventions {
	
	Acronyms are treated as one word 
	N.A.S.A. -> Nasa
	J.S.O.N. -> Json
	S.I.M.D. -> Simd
	L.O.L. ---> Lol
	S.2.C. ---> S2c
	
	One letter acronyms merge into the next acronym.
	J. U.T.F.8 -> Jutf8
	U. Int. -> Uint
	J. Word -> JWord --2 capitals, as word is not a acronym.
	A Func -> AFunc --A is ment as the word 'a', not some acronym
	
	Crates and modules use snake_case in code, and kebab-case outside of it.
	
	Structs, enums, enum variants, traits and unions are treated as constants that store types.
	Arguments and fields are treated as variables or constants.
	Variables uee lowerCamelCase.
	Constants use snake_case.
	Constants use PascalCase if they store types.
	
	Functions use camelCase.
	Functions use PascalCase if they return types.
	
	Use a module called "details" for implementation details that need to be exported.
