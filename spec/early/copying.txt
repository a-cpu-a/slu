Copy Trait {
	Marks a type as being memcpy-able.
	
	may be cheap or expensive, but not implicit.
}
Clone Trait {
	if T is Copy or Claim (or even both), then Clone is auto implemented. (auto impl uses memcpy)
	
	may be cheap or expensive, but not implicit.
}
Claim Trait {
	Marks a types clone impl as implicit, so it is called instead of moving (except at the last use, where a clone would be useless).
	The clone impl must not use panic or abort, it be O(1) and it should be useful.
	
	--TODO: could the name potentially be improved? "AutoCopy", "AutoClone", "ImplicitCopy", ...?
}

Copying {
	Copy,Clone or Claim can be used to create a copy.
	if a type implements Claim, then it goes from move-only, to auto-copy.
