Copy Trait {
	Marks a type as being memcpy-able.
	
	may be cheap or expensive, but not implicit.
}
Clone Trait {
	if T is Copy or Claim (or even both), then Clone is auto implemented. (auto impl uses memcpy)
	
	may be cheap or expensive, but not implicit.
}
Claim Trait {
	--TODO: what is the best way to enforce this? @DeriveClaim or something + make 'impl Claim' unsafe/illegal if Copy is implemented?
	If Copy is implemented, then this has to be a memcpy.
	
	simple copying that should be implicit. 
	Implementations must not use panic or abort.
	--TODO: could the name potentially be improved? "AutoCopy", "AutoClone", "ImplicitCopy", ...?
}

Copying {
	Copy,Clone or Claim can be used to create a copy.
	if a type implements Claim, then it goes from move-only, to auto-copy.
