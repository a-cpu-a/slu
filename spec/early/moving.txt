Move Trait {
	
	If a type is Copy, it is known to be Move too.
	
	Marks a type as being memmove-able.
	
	may be cheap or expensive.
}
Relocate Trait {
	method .relocate(in = &mut T,out = &mut T)
	if T is Move, then Relocate is auto implemented. (auto impl uses memcpy / memmove)
	
	may be cheap or expensive, shouldnt be too expensive.
}

Moving {
	Relocate's may be elided at any moment, it is not legal to rely on them happening, for example if a compiler boxes up all objects (java?), relocates might not even happen.
}
