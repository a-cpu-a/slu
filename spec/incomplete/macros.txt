New Keywords {

}

Macro {
	
	--TODO: a way to splice out basic keywords, like "mut", "ex" and "const"
	-- maybe token sequences?
	
	Creates a new global or local macro with a name 'Name', that cant be modified.
	
	Macro's must return one of the macro types (or a simple container of them), if you need to return something else, use a const function.
	
	macroSplice -> splices the token sequence(s) resulting from a expresion
	macroInvoke -> run a macro & splice it.
	The ">!(" ")!<" args mean that there is nothing surrounding the args.
	"macro" functions are ran at comptime.
	
	macroInvoke gets turned from 
	```slu
	macroWithArgs_Name_Stat!(myNameArg,local x = 44)
	```
	into 
	```slu
	@(macroWithArgs_Name_Stat(Name!{myNameArg},Stat!{local x = 44}))
	```
	
	Adding "macro" before a argument, makes it modify parsing behaviour, when
		using "macroInvoke", if there is no macro, then you need to pass it by value.
	
	You can call macro-functions like normal const functions.
	When doing that, you also need to use "()".
	
	When using ">!( )!<", you cant have more than 1 argument, and it cant be a list.
	
	If you have a CommaList in your args, it must be the last argument.
	
	adding a ! after the name of a macro def, makes it so it doesnt
	conflict with existing symbols,	it also means you cant call them in function-form
	
	@@ is converted to @.
	
	Error messages from macro code include both the macro splice-stack, and the place where it was spliced from.
	
	Implementation {
		
		Could be parsed without resolving into syntax elements, and then desugared into the real expression, statement, etc.
		
		Could be implemented by wrapping the input stream temporarily, while something needs to be spliced in.
