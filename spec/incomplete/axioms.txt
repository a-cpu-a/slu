Axioms {
	
	--TODO: how to apply rules, when an axiom is not used.
	--	And then, how to select annotations, only if they have a specific data & are in a specific crate.
	
	Axioms would let you choose the things you trust.
	
	They can also be extended using "impl axiom"
	
	
	Stable -> everything marked unstable, is safe (unless it is marked unsafe).
	
	std::AllStable -> all of std::* is marked as stable, so you dont need to wrap unstable code use in unsafe blocks.
	
	Js -> js only things become safe.
	Lua -> lua only things become safe.
	Ptr -> ptrs are safe.
	SingleThreaded -> assume compilation for single thread, so no need to worry about concurrent accesses.
	All -> everything is safe, no need to add unsafe blocks.
