Annotation {
	
	Allows adding info to stuff, for reflection, or compilation.
	
	There are some annotations that can change how code is compiled,
	or how code is exported, etc.
	Some annotations soft-error, when put on the wrong things, and thus are removed.
	
	The constructor arguments to annotations are optional, but in some cases you will need them, as not having them would conflict with other table constructors
	
	If there is a '^', then the annotation applies to the container its inside of, not the next item, it must be at the top of the block it is inside.
	
	Any type can be used as a annotation, as long as it is marked with @Annotation.
	Using a type that isnt marked with @Annotation is a soft-error, and @Annotation is added for you.
	
	Annotations only exist at compile-time, so you cant access them from run-time code.
	
	You can add multiple of the same annotation type, there is no limit of 1 per type.
	
	There cant be any spaces after the '---' for it to count as a string-based doc comment.
	LineOfText means that the full line is consumed until a newline and added as a doc comment, escapes are not read.
	Doc comments are desugared into '@Doc{txt="Comment text"}'.
	Doc comments with "^" are desugared into '@^Doc{txt="Comment text"}'.
	
}

New Annotations {
	@Annotation{} - Marks a type as a annotation.
	
	Example:
	```slu
	@Annotation
	struct FuncMarker {}
	
	@FuncMarker
	function myFn() {}
	```
	
	
	@Builtin{info=string} - Allows for referencing some builtin value, type, etc.
	The string is a namespaced path to something. 
	A soft-error is produced, if the builtin doesnt exist, and the annotation is ignored.
	
	Example:
	```slu
	ex const type Expr = @Builtin{"base::type/exp"}Unit;
	```
	
	
	@Cfg{onlyIf=bool} - Allows for conditional compilation based on a compile-time boolean expression.
	
	If the condition evaluates to `true`, the annotated code is included in the compilation.
	If the condition evaluates to `false`, the annotated code is **entirely omitted** from the compiled output.
	
	Example:
	```slu
	const IS_DEBUG = true;
	
	@Cfg{onlyIf=IS_DEBUG}
	function debugPrint(msg) {
		print("[DEBUG] " ++ msg);
	}
	
	@Cfg{!IS_DEBUG}
	function debugPrint(msg) {
		-- Debugging disabled, function is omitted at compile time
	}
	
	debugPrint("This will only exist if IS_DEBUG is true!");
	```
	
	@Entrypoint{name="..."}
	Mark a function as a entry-point, for every entry-point, the compiler will generate a file (they might be combined into 1 in some output forms, (wasm maybe?)).
	```slu
	@Entrypoint{"main"}
	fn main() {}
	```
	
	@EntrypointInit{}
	Mark a variable, for runtime initialization inside a entrypoint.
	Only applicable to global variables.

	```slu
	@EntrypointInit
	let Mutex(String) state = Mutex{"Hello"};

	-- State is immutable, but the string inside of it isnt.
	-- This is safe, as the mutex stops any concurent accesses, and it is only initialized once, before any code runs.
	-- However, it should still be avoided, as it makes testing harder.
	-- "state" might be initialized inside main(), or some dll's main()
	-- The variable exists per dll / executable, so referencing it from other code that is dynamically linked is an compiler-error.
	```
