Let Statement {
	
	Creates new local variable(s), that cant be modified, unless mut is added.
	
	Types are assigned automatically, when needed.
	
	
	Implementation {
		May be a local ?<const>? variable
		Or a global variable
		
		Possibly, equivalent to "local x = 1234", or "x = 1234", except, it can be exported.
		And if x is a table / whatever, its contents cant be edited, unless mut is added.
		
		The value might be frozen at runtime (metatable, or internal stuff)
		
		If something somehow modifies a const variable, the changes might be ignored.
