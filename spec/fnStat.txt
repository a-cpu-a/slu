Fn Statement {
	
	Creates a new global function with a name `Name`, that cant be modified.
	
	If the "struct" tag is added, then this function returns a nominal/strong type, and it must always return a type or a error.
	

    If the return type is missing, then it is assumed to be Unit.

	Params are immutable / constant by default.
	
	
	Implementation {
		In lua, this can be a local function, or a global function, could also be a table with a special metatable.
		Partially equivalent to "local function x() end", except, it can be exported.
		The function might be frozen at runtime (metatable, or internal stuff)
		If something somehow modifies the function variable, the changes might be ignored.
	}
