New Keywords {
	const
}

Const Keyword {
	
	This can mark something to only run at compile-time.
	
	It can be used on a expression to make it run a compile-time,
	this means you can speed up things like string concatentation,
	it will error, if the expression uses something from the runtime.
	
	It can mark a function, or variable as compile-time evaluated.
	
	Using comptime on global variables lets you initialize the values at compile-time.
	On functions, it means that they must be executed at compile-time.
	
	When using it on "const" local variables, the variables might be moved over to some private global state.
	
	
	`const(exp)` can be used to force a expression to be run at compile-time
	
	
	When there is a panic, or a error is propagated outside of compile-time const evaluation, a compiler error must be issued.
	
	Implementation {
		Likely just compile the needed functions, variables, constants, types into some lua_state/mlir context, then run/jit it.
		And then cache the results, until something changes.
		
		Dangerous libraries like "debug", "io", "os" are disabled inside const.
		
		note: (All normal functions can be evaluated at compile-time and runtime)
