Official Types {

	(names starting with a capital are complex types)
	
	trait {
		Represents some trait as a value.
	}
	type {
		Represents some type as a value.
	}
	lifetime {
		Represents some lifetime as a value.
	}
	void {
		A unit, used as the default type.
	}
	bool {
		A boolean, either true or false
	}
	integer {
		A 25, 32, 64, or 54 bit integer
		54 bit integers are only for luajit, and older versions of lua (can store up to 2^53).
		25 bit integers are for 32bit versions of lua pre 5.3 (can store up to 2^24
		
		Slu types can be cast into this, any overflows are still errors.
		
		Platform specific, so on some very old platforms, might be 8 or 16 bit sized.
	}
	NumVec {
		a vector of numbers, ment for vectorial operations
		```
		const u8x4 = NumVec(4,u8);
		--...
		let mulRes = 100 * u8x4{4,3,2,1};
		```
	}
	fastnum {
		A 32 or 64 bit float, might also be a integer on some lua versions.
		
		Slu types can be cast into this, any overflows are still errors.
	}
	
	Any {
		Any type is allowed, except void
	}
	str {
		A part of a owning string, immutable.
		
		a reference to a string of utf8 bytes, or utf16 chars.
		
		Must be valid utf16, with no malformed surrogate pairs, or valid utf8, using the old standard that allows charaters up to 32~ bits, without any surrogate pairs.
		
		On most hosts the contents are utf8, some hosts, like java & javascript use utf16.
	}
	String {
		A mutable string.
		
		Same restrictions on content as "str".
		
		Creating invalid content isnt ub in itself, but some libraries or functions will not handle that correctly.
	}
	Table {
		A lua like table, can have fields and indices
		Valid keys: any primitive type (Table,Func,String,uX,iX,fX,true/false,...), except void or NaN. 
		Yes, this also includes floats and negative numbers.
	}
	Userdata {
		Special data passed from the compiler
	}
	f8,f16,f128 {
		Reserved, may be used in the future.
		(intended for uses outside of simple hosts like lua, but will be supported inside them, when added)
	}
	f32,f64 {
		32 or 64 bit floats.
		
		Implementation {
			If f32/f64 is not natively supported, then it is emulated.
			If the native implementation has bugs, then it is also emulated.
		}
	}
	i8,i16,i32,i64,i128 {
		Optimized 8,16,32,64 or 128 bit signed integers.
		Implementation {
			i32, i64 may be emulated on platforms like luajit, or 32bit versions of lua.
			i128 is always emulated in lua.
		}
	}
	u8,u16,u32,u64,u128 {
		Optimized 8,16,32,64 or 128 bit unsigned integers.
		Implementation {
			u32, u64 may be emulated on platforms like luajit, or 32bit versions of lua.
			u64 multiplication, division, modulo, exp are all emulated on normal lua, (luajit might be optimized when possible).
			u128 is always emulated in lua.
		}
	}
	n8,n16,n32,n64,n128 {
		Optimized 8,16,32,64 or 128 bit unsigned integers with a +1, meaning 0 is not a valid number in these.
		Implementation {
			Could be a u___, but adding +1 when necessary.
			Could also be a u(___+1)
		}
	}
	usize {
		u32, u48, u54, u64, ... depending on platform.
	}
	isize {
		i___, same bits as usize
	}
	nsize {
		n___, same bits as usize
	}
}

Type Specifiers {
	
	-- In theory, there could be a refinement/liquid type specifier like this: "T : |v| v!=0 " or "T : myPredicateTakingT"
	-- this could also be chained: "T : |v| v!=0 : |v| v%2==0 : |v| v>-9999"
	-- it would be best to put the precedence above: mut, ~~, but bellow: ++
	
	
	Slice {
		Format: "[" X "]"
		
		Unlike table arrays, negative or zero indices will error.
		Out of bounds access will also error.
		
		Implementation {
			Accessing elements through normal lua code is not supported, unless exported to lua.
			
			multi-dimensional arrays must not be flattened into 1 dimension, unless sizes can be predicted at compile time.
			
			The compiler must prove that indices will always be valid, before removing run-time checks.
		}
	}
	Result {
		Format: [X] "~~" X
		Format: [X] "?"
		
		Allows both a error, and a value, or just an error, and the value type is inferred.
		The type specifier '?' is just like unary '~~', except the error type is inferred.
		When '?' is used alone, both the value and error type is inferred.
		
		Allows use of the "?" operator, and other error handling tools.
	}
	Borrow {
		Format "&" {borrowLifetime} [shMutConst] X
		
		Makes the type borrowing, this means that it is a borrowed value.
		
		Const -> only 1 reference, immutable
		nothing -> many reference, immutable
		Mut -> only 1 reference, mutable
		Share -> many reference, mutable
		
		
		```slu
		let item1 = 4
		let item2 = 5
		
		let &/item1 u8 myRef = &item1;
		
		let &mut u8 myRef2 = &mut item2;-- The annotation is inferred here.
		
		drop myRef2;-- Required, because not adding this, will produce a soft-error.
		
		let &/item1/item2 u8 z = &item1;-- This requires dropping "myRef2", as you cant have 2 variables potentially holding a reference to the same variable.
		
		```
	}
	Deref {
		Format X ".*"
		
		Represents a dereferenced borrow / ptr.
		
		```slu
		
		let intX = 4;
		
		let &mut u8.* xAlias = intX;
		xAlias = 3;
		drop xAlias; --Allow use of intX, once again
		
		assertEq!(intX,3);
		
		unsafe {
			let *mut u8.* xAliasUnsafe = (*mut intX).*;
			xAliasUnsafe = 2;
		}
		assertEq!(intX,2);
		
		
		let intXBorrow = &intX;
		
		let &/intX u8.* intXAlias = intXBorrow.*; --The type represents, a derefed reference for some u8 with lifetime "intX".
		let intXCopy = intXBorrow.*; --The type is just u8, as a trivial copy was possible.
		
		```
	}
	Pointer {
		Format "*" [shMutConst] X
		
		Makes the type a pointer.
		
		```slu
		let firstArg = 1;
		let secondArg = 2;
		
		
		--Its (mostly) safe to make pointers, but not to use them.
		--Some hosts dont support pointers. (Most do, like js,java,lua,cpp, ...)
		
		let *const u8 myPtr = *const firstArg;
		
		let *mut u8 myPtr2 = *mut secondArg;
		
		drop myPtr2;--Drops the pointer, not really meaningfull
		
	:::unsafe:
	
		let *mut u8 firstArgPtr = *mut firstArg;
		
		firstArgPtr = 4;
		
		```
	}
